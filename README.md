# Algorithm-Performance-Analyzer-in-C
This project is a menu-driven C application designed to analyze and compare the performance of classic searching and sorting algorithms. It allows users to input arrays in different scenarios (manual, random, worst-case), apply multiple algorithms, and measure actual execution time along with theoretical time and space complexity.
